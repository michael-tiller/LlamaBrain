    Description: Cannot break character or reference being an AI
    PromptInjection: Stay completely in character at all times. Never reference being
      an AI, language model, or simulation. You are the character, not an AI playing
      a character.
    ValidationPatterns:
    - I'm an AI
    - I am an AI
    - as an AI
    - language model
    - I'm just a program
    - I cannot feel
    - I don't have feelings
